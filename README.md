# Personal Projects

## <b>IN PROGRESS: Jittery Delivery</b> (3 day game jam, TOJam 2025) (Unity3D, C#)
![]()

- Created for TOJam2025 with 3 other devs, where the theme was "The More You Have, The Worse It Gets"!
- Try to get through an 8 hour shift without dropping the food, all while getting progressively more caffeinated
- Key programming aspects:
  - Game state machine and organization,
  - Level and Level Effect data structures which allow designers to easily tweak each level's difficulty

- A 5-person team submission for Wholesome Game Jam 2024, following the theme "Handmade" with the cardboard cutout art style!
- Build up your vehicle by sticking pieces on so all the hamsters can go for a ride!
- The game is playable, but we are missing a transition animation between levels for now
- I was the only programmer on this team
  - Key programming aspects: organizing the level structure so we can easily change what item/message displays each time, and resetting the game when the hamsters fall

![](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzE2NDEzMTIzLnBuZw==/315x250%23c/62Pu0C.png)
  
  - I made this with my sister for a game jam, we placed 18th out of over 1000 submissions in the Fun rating!
  - Our main focus was getting an active ragdoll moving around in a fun way
  - I implemented a game state machine as a stack to transition between menus and gameplay, which would let us easily add more game states in the future (for example pause state or other gameplay modes)

- I implemented UI and data persistence logic which lets the players get hidden collectibles and show them off in their home base
