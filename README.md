  - I made this with my sister for a game jam, we placed 18th out of over 1000 submissions in the Fun rating!
  - Our main focus was getting an active ragdoll moving around in a fun way
  - I implemented a game state machine as a stack to transition between menus and gameplay, which would let us easily add more game states in the future (for example pause state or other gameplay modes)

- Game based around destructible environments, initially developed in Unity3D and carried in Unreal
- I was the sole programmer on this and integrated various libraries/packages to get the gameplay, destructible environments, and terrain generation working
